# Cities skylines enhanced fudged population mod
An enhanced version of the cities skylines fudged population mod

### What is it?
This mod is a slightly enhanced version of this mod http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=406841580.

### What is different?
The main difference is that the the fudged population actually will take place of the real simulated population. 

### What if I want to see the original cities skylines population?
If the original population is preferred then simply click on the green person icon next to the population to toggle between the two displays.

### Why would I want this?
To make your city feel like it is bigger than what really is. Ignorance is Bliss right?
